    <h4>What will be the result for these expressions?
        <h5>1) Result of 5 > 4 </h5>
        <p>true</p>

        <h5>2) "apple" > "pineapple"</h5>
        <p>false because Since 'a' comes before 'p' in the Unicode table, "apple" is considered less than "pineapple."
            Therefore, the expression "apple" > "pineapple" evaluates to false in JavaScript.
        </p>

        <h5>3) "2" > "12"</h5>
        <p>true because Since '2' comes after '1' in the Unicode table, "2" is considered greater than "12." Therefore,
            the expression "2" > "12" evaluates to true in JavaScript.</p>

        <h5>4) undefined == null</h5>
        <p>true Reason... In JavaScript, undefined is a primitive data type that represents the absence of a value, and
            null is also a primitive data type that represents the intentional absence of a value. They are often used
            interchangeably in certain contexts, but they are not exactly the same.</p>
    </h4>

    <h5>5) undefined === null</h5>
    <p>false they both are different data type (primitive data type)</p>

    <h5>6) null == "\n0\n"</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>null is a special primitive value representing the intentional absence of any object value.
        </li>
        <li>"\n0\n" is a string that contains newline characters at the beginning and end, with "0" in between.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>False, Since null is not a string, the type coercion attempts to convert "\n0\n" to a number or null to make the
        comparison valid. The result of converting "\n0\n" to a number is 0, but null is not equal to 0. Hence, the
        comparison evaluates to false.</p>


    <h4>what will be output of alert(null||2||undefined)</h4>
    <pre>alert(null||2||undefined) //output is 2</pre>


    <h4>Write a program showing alert</h4>
    <p><Button onclick="showalert()">Press To Alert</Button></p>

    <h4>Write a program confirming age </h4>
    <p><Button onclick="Age()">Age </Button></p>
        <script>
            // alert(null||2||undefined) //output is 2

            function showalert(){
                alert('alert is triggered')
            }

            function Age(){
                let age = prompt('enter age');
                if (age>18) {
                    return confirm('You are eligible')
                }
                else{
                    return confirm('Did your parent allowed you?')
                }
            }
            Age()
